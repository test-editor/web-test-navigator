This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Setup development

Make sure to have a working [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) installation. Please ensure that the `nixpkgs-unstable` channel is available. It
can be added with `nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable`.

To enter the development environment, execute `NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix-shell` in this repos root directory. For even more convenience,
please install [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) which will enter the development environment automatically for you.

Once within the development environment, run `yarn install` to resolve all necessary dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
